# Conflict of Interest

Various individuals of the Nix community have an affirmative obligation to act at all times in the best interests of the organization. This policy serves to define the term "conflict of interest," to assist members of the Steering Committee (SC), candidates to the SC, and other individuals in identifying and disclosing such conflicts, and to minimize the impact of such conflicts on the actions of the SC whenever possible.

## What Constitutes a Conflict of Interest

Conflict of Interest (CoI) is any duty a covered individual has that has an interest

Examples of CoI may include: full or part time work, subsidiaries, grants, gifts, sponorship, or otherwise the same payer of Nix related work. This list is non-exhaustive.

## Covered Individuals

A covered individual is anyone that needs to disclose their CoI(s).

## Active Steering Committee Members

Active steering committee members are considered Covered Individuals

## Steering Committee Candidates

The candidates must disclose current CoIs and already-agreed-upon changes of affiliation that are to happen during the term.

In case of doubts on what constitutes the same CoI the Election Committee (EC) decides.

When all candidates are known but before the voting period starts, the EC must publicly commit [TODO: WHERE?] the list of candidates that share a CoI.

## When

Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest should happen in the following times and places...

| Situation                            | Where disclosure must happen                                               | Timeline for disclosure                            |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Election for Covered Individual      | In canditate response form                                                 | when candidate responses are released              |
| Change in CoI for Covered Individual | On the [relevant team page](https://nixos.org/community/#governance-teams) | Upon earliest knowledge of the affected individual |

## Handling Mutiple Members of the SC Holding the Same CoI

### Active Steering Committee Members

There is a hard maximum of two members with the same CoI at any time. If this condition is suspected to be violated because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, all non-involved currently serving SC members will have a simple majority decision over whether there is a violation. In the case it is deemed a violation, sufficient members of the committee must resign until the max representation limit is achieved. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to resign, all members with that same CoI will be removed and a special election shall be held.

## Steering Committee Candidates

There is a soft limit [TODO: DEFINE SOFT] of one individual with the same CoI immediately after election results coming into force.

If the results of an election would result in multiple individuals with the same CoI being elected, the lowest vote getters with any particular CoI will be removed until the condition is satisfied. Note that everybody's vote still has the same impact, because each voter is asked to evaluate all candidates.

## Failure to Disclose

If the Steering Committee has reasonable cause to believe that a covered individual of the Organization has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, including those arising from a transaction with a related interested person, it shall inform such covered individual of the basis for this belief and afford the covered individual an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. If, after hearing the covered individualâ€™s response and making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Steering Committee determines that the covered individual has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, the Steering Committee shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
