# Conflict of Interest

Various individuals of the Nix community have an affirmative obligation to act at all times in the best interests of the Nix organization. This policy serves to define the term "conflict of interest(s) CoI(s)," to assist members of the Steering Committee (SC), candidates for the SC, and other individuals in identifying and disclosing such conflicts, and to minimize the impact of such conflicts on the actions of the Nix Organization whenever possible.

## What Constitutes a Conflict of Interest

Conflict of Interest is any duty a covered individual has that has an interest in Nix or Nix adjacent work.

A non-exhaustive list of examples of CoIs:
- full or part time work
- subsidiaries
- grants
- gifts
- sponorship
- a payer of Nix related work

## Covered Individuals

A covered individual is any individual that needs to disclose their CoI(s).

Covered individuals are listed below but there may be other times when individuals not listed below must disclose their CoI(s); eg [endorsing a new SC Candidate](./constitution.md#candidates)

### Active Steering Committee Members

Active steering committee members are considered Covered Individuals without reservation.

### Steering Committee Candidates

Candidates for the SC must disclose current CoIs and already-agreed-upon changes of affiliation that would change their CoI(s) that are to happen during their term.

In case of doubts on what constitutes the same CoI the Election Committee (EC) has the power to deterime if two CoI(s) are the same.

When all candidates are known but before the voting period starts, the EC must publicly commit, in a place of their choosing, the list of candidates that share a CoI.

## How to disclose a Conflict of Interest

Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest should happen in the following times and places...

| Individual                                                   | Where disclosure must happen                                                  | Timeline for disclosure                            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Election for Covered Individual                              | In canditate response form/or other appropriate place as determined by the EC | When candidate responses are released              |
| Endorsing in an election for Covered Individual              | Appropriate place as determined by the EC                                     | Upon endorsement, or as determined by the EC       |
| Change in CoI for an elected Covered Individual              | On the [relevant team page](https://nixos.org/community/#governance-teams)    | Upon earliest knowledge of the affected individual |
| Nix Governance Team Member (who is not a Covered Individual) | On the [relevant team page](https://nixos.org/community/#governance-teams)    | If desired                                         |

## Handling Mutiple Members of the SC Holding the Same CoI

### Active Steering Committee Members

There is a limit of two members with the same CoI at any time. If this condition is suspected to be violated, all non-involved currently serving SC members will have a simple majority decision over whether there is a violation. In the case it is deemed a violation, sufficient members of the committee must resign until the max representation limit is achieved. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to resign, all members with that same CoI will be removed and a special election shall be held.

### Steering Committee Candidates

There is a limit of one individual with the same CoI immediately after election results coming into force.

As per the [constitution](/doc/constitution.md#candidates) an individual may not be a candidate for the SC if they share a CoI with a current SC who will not be vacating their seat this election cycle.

If the results of an election would result in multiple individuals with the same CoI being elected, the lowest vote getters with any particular CoI will be removed until the condition is satisfied. Note that everybody's vote still has the same impact, because each voter is asked to evaluate all candidates.

## Failure to Disclose

If the Steering Committee has reasonable cause to believe that a covered individual has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform such covered individual of the basis for this belief and afford the covered individual an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. After hearing the covered individualâ€™s response and making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the SC determines that the covered individual has failed to disclose an actual CoI, the SC shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
